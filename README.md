<!-- Brief -->
<p align="center">
The TEXT Utils app is an easy to use and user-friendly text utility app, which can be used to manipulate the given text by switching case, counting words . NEWS API was used to fetch real-time data, I have used the developer pack so I cannot host it on any browser other than the local host, that's why I didn't provide any demo website link.

## Key Features

- This website displays the news headlines along with the corresponding image for that news.

- It also equips the mordern infinite scroll feature, in the earlier version I have used buttons for navigation.

- Different sections are mentioned in the nav bar.

- Its a single page site which gives a good user experience. I does not load the whole page instead just the new data is mounted on the same site.

- Styled Bootstrap components are used to make website reponsive and visually appealing.

- User can toggle between the light mode and dark mode.

## My process

### Built with

- React
- Bootstrap
- React Query
- React Router
- React Hook Form
- Styled Components

### What I Learned

- **React Fundamentals:** I gained a solid understanding of React, including components, state management, and routing, allowing me to build dynamic user interfaces.

- **Responsive UI Design:** Styled Components were used to create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces that adapt to various screen sizes.

- **Routing and Navigation:** React Router facilitated smooth navigation and seamless transitions between different views and pages within the application.

- **Compound Component Pattern:** I implemented the Compound Component Pattern to create cohesive and reusable component groups, improving the organization and maintainability of the code.

- **Dark Mode Implementation:** Dark mode was implemented to offer users a personalized visual experience and accommodate different preferences.

- **Color Pallets Implementation:** This app comes with different coloring options according to the user's choice.

- **Git Version Control:** I practiced effective version control using Git, allowing for code management, and tracking project changes.

- **Project Planning and Management:** I gained experience in planning and managing a large-scale project, including feature development, bug fixing, and testing.

By building "NEWS Monkey" project with these technologies and concepts, I've developed a comprehensive set of skills and knowledge that can be applied to future projects and real-world scenarios. This experience has not only expanded my technical expertise but also improved my problem-solving capabilities.
